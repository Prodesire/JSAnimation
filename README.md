# Book Description

*[Foundation HTML5 Animation with JavaScript](http://amzn.com/1430236655?tag=html5anim-20)*, by [Billy Lamberta](http://lamberta.org) and [Keith Peters](http://www.bit-101.com), covers everything that you need to know to create dynamic, scripted animations using the HTML5 canvas. It provides information on all the relevant math you'll need, before moving on to physics concepts like acceleration, velocity, easing, springs, collision detection, conservation of momentum, 3D, and forward and inverse kinematics. *[Foundation HTML5 Animation with JavaScript](http://amzn.com/1430236655?tag=html5anim-20)* is a fantastic resource for all web developers working in HTML5 or switching over from Flash to create standards-compliant games, applications, and animations that will work across all modern browsers and most mobile devices, including iPhones, iPads, and Android devices.

*What you'll have fun learning:*

* All the JavaScript and HTML5 code (including math and trigonometry functions) you'll need to start animating with code.
* Basic motion principles like velocity, acceleration, friction, easing, and bouncing.
* How to handle user interactions via the keyboard, mouse, and touchscreen.
* Advanced motion techniques like springs, coordinate rotation, conservation of momentum, and forward and inverse kinematics.
* All the basic 3D concepts you'll need for 3D in HTML5 (without WebGL)â€”from simple perspective to full 3D solids, complete with backface culling and dynamic lighting.
